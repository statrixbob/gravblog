Hauling rocks for a good cause.

===

A friend from work emailed a link to the [Paepae O He'eia](http://paepaeoheeia.org/panikapuka/) site and request for volunteers. 

It seemed like a great way to spend a morning, helping the community, getting a view I might not otherwise get, and a bit of exercise to boot.

It was all of that and more.

The day started early with my buddy Andy picking up myself and a friend from work around 7:30 AM. We needed to be out to Kaneohe early as we couldn't park near the fishpond, but would be bussed in from a nearby shopping center. We were actually quite early, perhaps even too much so, but parking was easy and we hopped on a bus for a five minute ride to the site without much ado.

On arrival we descended a steep driveway the headquarters were quite a few folks were being instructed and then sent off to 'line.'
