I was one of the 2000 or so folks that journeyed to the He'eia Fishpond on December 12, 2015 for the [Pani ka Puka] (http://paepaeoheeia.org/panikapuka/) event.]

It was a wonderful event, though I'll admit I hadn't hauled rocks for…um…about 40 years. 

*More in a bit, I want to see if this all actually works.*
