Hauling rocks for a good cause.

===

A friend from work emailed a link to the [Paepae O He'eia](http://paepaeoheeia.org/panikapuka/) site and request for volunteers. 

It seemed like a great way to spend a morning, helping the community, getting a view I might not otherwise get, and a bit of exercise to boot.

It was all of that and more.
